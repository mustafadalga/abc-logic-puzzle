## What is the ABC Logic Puzzle?
ABC Logic Puzzle is a table-filling game that has its own unique set of rules distinct from other table-filling games. It requires players to fill a table with the letters 'A', 'B', and 'C' while adhering to specific conditions. The game's difficulty is determined by the size of the table and the number of hints provided. As the table size increases and the number of hints decreases, the game becomes more challenging.


### Game Rules
* Players must fill the table such that the letters 'A', 'B', and 'C' each appear only once in every row and column.
* Hints are provided outside the table. Each external hint indicates the first visible letter from that viewpoint within the table.
* The primary objective of the game is to fill the table by ensuring that the provided letters (A, B, C) appear only once in each row and column. Players should use the external hints to assist them in achieving this goal.
* Upon correctly populating the table while considering the external hints and ensuring each of the letters 'A', 'B', and 'C' appear only once in every row and column, players will have successfully completed the puzzle.
